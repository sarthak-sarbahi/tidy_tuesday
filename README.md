# TidyTuesday
### A weekly data project in R from the R4DS online learning community

[#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is a weekly event by the **R4DS Online Learning Community**. Every week a raw dataset and a chart or article related to that dataset are posted, and people are expected to explore the data and come up with interesting insights and visualisations. The goal of TidyTuesday is to apply R skills, get feedback, explore otherâ€™s work, and connect with the greater #RStats community! The intent of Tidy Tuesday is to provide a safe and supportive forum for individuals to practice their wrangling and data visualization skills independent of drawing conclusions. Although the two are related, the focus of this practice is purely on building skills with real-world data.

***Using this repository, I share my #TidyTuesday code and visualizations!***
